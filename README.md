## Download

To download the latest version, go to the [**Releases**](https://github.com/jamescastells/pokemon-rgb/releases) page and grab the latest IPS file. Use an IPS patcher and apply the IPS file to a Pokémon Red ROM.

If you'd like to build from source, see [**INSTALL.md**](INSTALL.md).

## Browser Build

This repository also includes an embeddable browser player that runs `pokered.gbc` through a WebAssembly build of `binjgb`.

To build it locally:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
make web binjgb_emscripten_cmake=/absolute/path/to/Emscripten.cmake
make serve-web
```

The player is emitted to `dist/web/player.html`, with the ROM, WASM runtime, and version metadata staged under `dist/web/assets/`.
